  "authors": "Tim De Ryck, Siddhartha Mishra, Deep Ray",
  "abstract": "Deep neural networks and the ENO procedure are both efficient frameworks for approximating rough functions. We prove that at any order, the ENO interpolation procedure can be cast as a deep ReLU neural network. This surprising fact enables the transfer of several desirable properties of the ENO procedure to deep neural networks, including its high-order accuracy at approximating Lipschitz functions. Numerical tests for the resulting neural networks show excellent performance for approximating solutions of nonlinear conservation laws and at data compression.",
