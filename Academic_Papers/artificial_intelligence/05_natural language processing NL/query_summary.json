      "abstract": "While we pay attention to the latest advances in clinical natural language processing (NLP), we can notice some resistance in the clinical and translational research community to adopt NLP models due to limited transparency, interpretability, and usability. In this study, we proposed an open natural language processing development framework. We evaluated it through the implementation of NLP algorithms for the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). Based on the interests in information extraction from COVID-19 related clinical notes, our work includes 1) an open data annotation process using COVID-19 signs and symptoms as the use case, 2) a community-driven ruleset composing platform, and 3) a synthetic text data generation workflow to generate texts for information extraction tasks without involving human subjects. The corpora were derived from texts from three different institutions (Mayo Clinic, University of Kentucky, University of Minnesota). The gold standard annotations were tested with a single institution's (Mayo) ruleset. This resulted in performances of 0.876, 0.706, and 0.694 in F-scores for Mayo, Minnesota, and Kentucky test datasets, respectively. The study as a consortium effort of the N3C NLP subgroup demonstrates the feasibility of creating a federated NLP algorithm development and benchmarking platform to enhance multi-institution clinical NLP study and adoption. Although we use COVID-19 as a use case in this effort, our framework is general enough to be applied to other domains of interest in clinical NLP.",

      "abstract": "Java Code Generation consists in generating automatically Java code from a Natural Language Text. This NLP task helps in increasing programmers' productivity by providing them with immediate solutions to the simplest and most repetitive tasks. Code generation is a challenging task because of the hard syntactic rules and the necessity of a deep understanding of the semantic aspect of the programming language. Many works tried to tackle this task using either RNN-based, or Transformer-based models. The latter achieved remarkable advancement in the domain and they can be divided into three groups: (1) encoder-only models, (2) decoder-only models, and (3) encoder-decoder models. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the evolution and progress of deep learning models in Java code generation task. We focus on the most important methods and present their merits and limitations, as well as the objective functions used by the community. In addition, we provide a detailed description of datasets and evaluation metrics used in the literature. Finally, we discuss results of different models on CONCODE dataset, then propose some future directions.",

      "abstract": "Automatic multiple-choice question generation (MCQG) is a useful yet challenging task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It is the task of automatic generation of correct and relevant questions from textual data. Despite its usefulness, manually creating sizeable, meaningful and relevant questions is a time-consuming and challenging task for teachers. In this paper, we present an NLP-based system for automatic MCQG for Computer-Based Testing Examination (CBTE).We used NLP technique to extract keywords that are important words in a given lesson material. To validate that the system is not perverse, five lesson materials were used to check the effectiveness and efficiency of the system. The manually extracted keywords by the teacher were compared to the auto-generated keywords and the result shows that the system was capable of extracting keywords from lesson materials in setting examinable questions. This outcome is presented in a user-friendly interface for easy accessibility.",

      "abstract": "Smart cities provide an efficient infrastructure for the enhancement of the quality of life of the people by aiding in fast urbanization and resource management through sustainable and scalable innovative solutions. The penetration of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in smart cities has been a major contributor to keeping up with the agility and pace of their development. In this paper, we have explored Natural Language Processing (NLP) which is one such technical discipline that has great potential in optimizing ICT processes and has so far been kept away from the limelight. Through this study, we have established the various roles that NLP plays in building smart cities after thoroughly analyzing its architecture, background, and scope. Subsequently, we present a detailed description of NLP’s recent applications in the domain of smart healthcare, smart business, and industry, smart community, smart media, smart research, and development as well as smart education accompanied by NLP’s open challenges at the very end. This work aims to throw light on the potential of NLP as one of the pillars in assisting the technical advancement and realization of smart cities.",

      "abstract": "Advanced digital data-driven applications have evolved and significantly impacted the transportation sector in recent years. This systematic review examines natural language processing (NLP) approaches applied to aviation safety-related domains. The authors use Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) to conduct this review, and three databases (Web of Science, Scopus, and Transportation Research International Documentation) are screened. Academic articles from the period 2010–2022 are reviewed after applying two rounds of filtering criteria. The sub-domains, including aviation incident/accident reports analysis and air traffic control (ATC) communications, are investigated. The specific NLP approaches, related machine learning algorithms, additional causality models, and the corresponding performance are identified and summarized. In addition, the challenges and limitations of current NLP applications in aviation, such as ambiguity, limited training data, lack of multilingual support, are discussed. Finally, this review uncovers future opportunities to leverage NLP models to facilitate the safety and efficiency of the aviation system.",

Due to advancements in information and communication technology over the last ten years, NLP has gained increased awareness and has been the subject of several studies. Understanding the steps required to advance literary understanding is so crucial. The study's objective is to provide an organized review of the literature in NLP research using bibliometric analysis. In the discipline of NLP, the study highlights important research fields, research clusters, cited publications, significant authors, institutions, nations, and publishing patterns. From the Web of Science (WoS) database, 12541 NLP papers were taken out and subjected to further bibliometric analysis The outcome showed that the largest number of NLP publications occurred in 2021, with the first publication being in 1989. The leading journal with the most publications was IEEE Access, and NLP papers have earned the most citations—3174—than any other journal. Liu HF is the most productive author in the field of NLP, and Harward University is the most significant organization. When it comes to the overall amount of publications, the US is the top nation. Researchers looked at the applied sciences in great detail.",
