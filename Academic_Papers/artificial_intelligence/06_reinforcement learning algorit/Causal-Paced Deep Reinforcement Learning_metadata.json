  "abstract": "Designing effective task sequences is crucial for curriculum reinforcement learning (CRL), where agents must gradually acquire skills by training on intermediate tasks. A key challenge in CRL is to identify tasks that promote exploration, yet are similar enough to support effective transfer. While recent approach suggests comparing tasks via their Structural Causal Models (SCMs), the method requires access to ground-truth causal structures, an unrealistic assumption in most RL settings. In this work, we propose Causal-Paced Deep Reinforcement Learning (CP-DRL), a curriculum learning framework aware of SCM differences between tasks based on interaction data approximation. This signal captures task novelty, which we combine with the agent's learnability, measured by reward gain, to form a unified objective. Empirically, CP-DRL outperforms existing curriculum methods on the Point Mass benchmark, achieving faster convergence and higher returns. CP-DRL demonstrates reduced variance with comparable final returns in the Bipedal Walker-Trivial setting, and achieves the highest average performance in the Infeasible variant. These results indicate that leveraging causal relationships between tasks can improve the structure-awareness and sample efficiency of curriculum reinforcement learning. We provide the full implementation of CP-DRL to facilitate the reproduction of our main results at https://github.com/Cho-Geonwoo/CP-DRL.",
